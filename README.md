# PyTetris
Tetris 2d and 3d reinforcement learning environment

Pure numpy implementation of tetris in 2 and 3 dimensions. Simply specify board size when instantiating a game object

the game isn't really human playable though I may add some kind of interface to allow that kind of thing

Also the render methods aren't super obvious on how to use them since this package is really a refactor of [this project](https://github.com/PSZehnder/DeepTetris3d) and is designed to work with oleg, my [reinforcement learning library](https://github.com/PSZehnder/oleg)

More documentation to come (or maybe not...). Either way, check out the reinforcement learning project linked above for more.
